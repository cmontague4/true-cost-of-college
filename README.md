# true-cost-of-college
Application for calculating the true final cost of attending post-secondary education through a college or university after paying off tuition, loans, interest, and fees.

# Goal of the project 
Create a web application which a user can visit to calculate the "True Cost of College". This includes the current cost of a selected university over the duration of the degree, with extrapolation of tuition growth. Living on/off campus potentially. We also want to include a way to calculate total cost of any loans the student might take out including various repayment schedules.

# Current Project Major Deliverables
1. WebApp itself
2. Backend API for serving data

    2a. Retrieve school from an external source? Potentially https://nces.ed.gov/datatools/
    2b. Current interest rates? https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/api-documentation/

3. Deployment on some sort of server
